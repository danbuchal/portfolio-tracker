## The Story Behind Portfolio Tracker

Over ten years ago, I created the first version of Portfolio Tracker for my personal use. I shared it with Rob Berger (former owner of DoughRoller), and the response was incredible! He generously shared it with his audience, and it became the top Google search result for "[Best Investment Tracking Spreadsheet](https://www.google.com/search?q=best+investment+tracking+spreadsheet)".  Rob has featured it in numerous articles, [podcasts](http://traffic.libsyn.com/doughroller/DR_179--Free_Investment_Tracking_Spreadsheet.mp3?dest-id=168596) and YouTube [videos](https://youtu.be/l8vrmBIzICE?si=tEFLBzc8b_WzA7Jl).  You can find Rob's version [here](https://robberger.com/investment-tracking-spreadsheet/).

## Reimagined for Today

Leveraging the latest features available in Google Sheets, Portfolio Tracker was completely rebuilt from the ground up in late 2024. This new version offers a more powerful, intuitive, and flexible way to manage your portfolio. The goal remains the same: to provide you with clarity and control over your asset allocation.
