## History

I created the first version of Portfolio Tracker for my own use 10 years ago.  
At the time I was listening to a Podcast called DoughRoller hosted by Rob Berger.  
I sent the original version of this spreadsheet to him on March 5th, 2015 and since that time the response has been **\*amazing**.\*

Rob asked my permission to use my spreadsheet and to distribute it to his readers/listeners.  
He stripped down some of the functionality and has made small tweaks throughout the years, but what he [distributes today](https://robberger.com/investment-tracking-spreadsheet/) is largely the _same_ spreadsheet I sent him so long ago.  
His article is still the \#1 Google Search Result for “[Best Investment Tracking Spreadsheet](https://www.google.com/search?q=best+investment+tracking+spreadsheet)”

Since that time, he has written numerous articles, mentioned it on his [podcast](http://traffic.libsyn.com/doughroller/DR_179--Free_Investment_Tracking_Spreadsheet.mp3?dest-id=168596) and created [videos](https://youtu.be/l8vrmBIzICE?si=tEFLBzc8b_WzA7Jl) about it on his [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@rob_berger).

## Today

Since the day I created the initial version, Google Sheets has added some features. That got me thinking about updating Portfolio Tracker and making it something truly great.  
I started from scratch at the end of 2024 and completely re-imagined it with some of the new Google Sheets features in mind.

I certainly have nowhere near the audience that Rob has, but, this time I decided to “go it alone” and put myself out in the world. I’m truly proud of what I created and it has really helped me get an overview of my asset allocation in a way that I could not before. I _hope_ it can do the same for you\!
